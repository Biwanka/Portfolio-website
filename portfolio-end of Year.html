        <div class="portfolio__item-individual">
            <p> Theme 
                My board game revolves around the theme of teachers, specifically more towards elementary teachers.
                 It touches on the problems and difficulties that they go through. There will be three main
                  subjects that have happened since COVID-19 that are found in todays News. My game will touch
                   on more than these three subjects as I have talked to teachers, my mother being one of them, about
                   the teaching life. Firstly, this game touches on the lack of teachers 
                   This becomes a difficult situation as other teachers have to teach a different age group than their usual.
                    It also becomes a difficult matter as some teachers come and go Which makes it difficult for the students and work environment.
                     Another big problem that I touch on in my board game is the lack of funds and materials given to teachers
                     to the point that Teachers have to buy their supplies with their own money not just personal ones, but even for classrooms,
                       games, and materials for students. Teachers have a lot of materials needed to have a good teaching environment
                         I think that spending their own money so children can have a good learning environment is terrible.
                          Even more after the pandemic, they made a no sharing of supplies, so that each student can have material
                           without the risk of Covid. Therefore having to buy extra is a very difficult and demanding task even more
                            so when it is out of the teacher’s own pockets. The lack of funds effects also some teachers in their
                             classrooms. There are not enough funds for special classrooms, therefore more and more students with
                              special needs are integrated into ordinary classrooms. Teachers need to prepare an adapted version 
                              of the work to the level of each adapted child. They have to fill out many documents such as IEP‘s 
                              and have more meetings with parents and the school team. This demands a lot more planning time and 
                              the purchase of special materials that will again come from their pockets. If they have an attendant 
                              for a few hours in the class, they need time to explain to them what they want them to do with each 
                              child. How to manage the class when having to deal with the special needs students when they get 
                              disorganized and overwhelmed and an attendant is not in the class. There are many situations because
                               of the lack of funds that have affected teachers negatively. In addition, this lack of teachers
                                also makes teachers who teach a certain age group for a long time have to teach a new age group 
                                which means different materials having to re-buy all her materials at the
                                   same time as remaking a whole new teaching regiment for older students is a lot of added stress.
                                    A lot is demanded from teachers, to buy materials, make sure all students pass and have a safe
                                     good teaching environment, grading, deal with certain situations in class, class schedule and 
                                     more. When COVID arrived more things were demanded from teachers in keeping themselves safe and
                                      the kids, changing their planning even sometimes online, and trying to help students who took
                                       this change badly. Now in recent times, there is another problem that teachers have to be aware
                                        of and it is the heatwave. Many classrooms do not own AC or fans. Therefore this affects the
                                          students and also the teachers and coils affect someone’s health

             <p>The goal of the game: When all players reach the End of School Year without any of the meters having reached burnout, 
                then congratulations you win the game. All teachers survived the school year together.
            </p>
            <p>RuleBook: Active spaces </p>
                <p>-Coloured Legends: there are four coloured legends which contain what each coloured tile does if new players forget. </p>
               <p> - Start of School Year: The start space (Pink space).</p>
                <p>-End of School Year: The end goal (Pink space).</p>
               <p>-Empty tile: the grey tile which has no writings are just empty spaces where nothing happens.</p> 
                <p>-Sick Day: If you land on a Sick Day (Green space) anxiety increases by one. The reason is that teachers need to create a
                     teaching plan and send everything to the teacher that will replace them,
                     therefore still doing some work while sick and that is why the anxiety increases.</p>

<p>-Ped day (Pale Blue Space): If you land on this space, your anxiety will decrease by 1. It is a good space as pedagogical days are where teachers
 can have a break or more time to plan things.</p>
<p>-Emergency (Pale Red Space): If you land on this space the player that landed on it can have help from one teacher or help one 
teacher by exchanging one of their anxiety points. Situation one, if the player that landed on the space is not close to burnout they 
can help another player that is close to burnout by exchanging points, their anxiety will decrease by one (helping them) and you will 
increase by one. You can also do the contrary if the player who lands on the emergency space is close to burnout, he can ask the help of 
another player who isn’t close to burnout and receive one of his points. Your anxiety will decrease by one point (helping you) and the 
other player’s anxiety increase by one. Players are not obligated to do anything in this space. This active space was added as a way to 
add to the cooperative gameplay and also to show how much teachers help each other at work.</p>
<p>-Weekend (Orange Space): If you land on this space you have to advance two spaces. You will always land in a bad action space.
 It may be a Sick Day or Event as the weekend passes so fast and then Monday appears. Mondays are the worst.

        <div class="portfolio__item-individual">
          
            <p> - Event cards: When you land in an Event space (Purple space), the player has to pick up an Event card which is the same colour as the space. 
                These cards contain events that happen to the teachers in their class or at school. These events will increase the teacher’s anxiety, however,
                 almost all events except a couple can have a specific teacher that could help you and make you lose no anxiety. If a teacher can help, it will 
                 be specified on the card. However, each teacher only has two help tokens. This means players need to be strategic about when they need to help.</p>
              <p> Examples of different types of event cards:</p> 
               <p>A student punches another student. The Special Ed teacher can help or anxiety increases by 2.</p> 
               <p>A student in your class has been disrupting the entire class all week, and none of your interventions have worked.
                Confront the parents in person and anxiety increases by 2 but gain a redo in the report card or send them a letter and nothing happens.
                </p> 
               <p>-Special card: When you land in a Special space (Yellow space), you can pick up a Special card which is the same colour as the space.
                These cards contain a nice situation that gives teachers less stress therefore your anxiety will decrease.</p> 
                <p>Example: </p>
               <p>A Parent donated school supplies. Anxiety decreases by 2.</p>

        </div>



        <div class="portfolio__item-individual">
            <p> -Report card (Turquoise Green Space): Every player is obligated to stop on it even if your die role goes further than that space.
                 There are only three report card spaces which indicate the three report cards of an elementary school year which is why every teacher 
                 is obligated to interact with them. When you are on a report card, pick an Exam card which is the same colour as the space. This card 
                 will contain the subject of the exam and a mini-game. Certain cards can be teamed games where all the teachers will participate while
                  other cards are questioning exams in which only the player that landed on the space participates. If the player successfully passes 
                  the mini-game (exam) then their anxiety decreases by 1 as your students did well on their report cards. If you fail the mini-game, 
                  the player that landed on the space will need to roll a dice containing numbers of 1, 2 and 3. The number that the die lands on will 
                  determine the amount of anxiety points the player will increase. Demonstrating the gravity of your student’s performance.
                Examples of different types of Exam cards:
                </p>
              <p>Science Exam: For all teachers roll all 6 dice with letters and come up with a word that starts with that letter
                 and from the exam subject. (Example if they teach Science [all the words would have to be about science.] 
                 If they roll a B, they could use the word Beaker)
            </p> 
               <p>True or False (History): Most scholars now believe that Shakespeare did not write most of the plays that bear his name. (False) 
            </p> 
               <p>A student in your class has been disrupting the entire class all week, and none of your interventions have worked.
                Confront the parents in person and anxiety increases by 2 but gain a redo in the report card or send them a letter and nothing happens.
                </p> 
               <p> -Teacher ID: Each player will pick a random card from the Teacher ID deck. 
                This, in turn, will assign a teacher persona for each player. May it be a gym teacher,
                 art, math, special ED teacher and so on. This identification card will have the subject that the teacher teaches and their skill.  </p>
               <p> -Example: English Teacher, Skill: Can help in situations involving parents.</p>
          <p>This skill is specific to each teacher and will help the players in future situations with Event cards.
           The player could help themselves or other players, it is as they wish. However, players have to be mindful
            as each of them can only help twice during the whole game. Therefore, they will have to see what is a priority
             and choose when they help and when they don’t. Each player is given two tokens that represent the amount of time
              they can help. After they help someone, the player gets rid of the token to keep track. When you have no more tokens 
              you cannot help anymore. The moment a player arrives at the End of School Year space they will be unable to help any of
               the teachers in event situations, emergencies, or mini-game exams. Therefore, if they still have tokens to help other teachers,
                those tokens then become useless as the teacher will not work overtime</p>

        <div class="portfolio__item-individual">
           
               <p>-Class Period: After each player has chosen their board game piece colour, place them in the Start of the School Year space. 
                Each player will pick the Class Period card to see in what order people will play. When it’s your turn, you roll the dice and
                 move the number of spaces indicated. After your turn is over, put back your Class Period card face down in the middle to indicate
                  that your turn is over. When everyone played, all Class Period cards should be back in the middle. Shuffle them a bit and each
                   player picks again until the end of the game. 
            </p> 
                
            <p>- Burnout Meter: The game is as follows. Each player will be assigned a burnout meter this meter 
                will be the reason for winning or losing the game. The thermometer has 8 anxiety spaces in addition 
                to an OK space and a Burnout space. Each player places a white bead on the OK space at the top of the
                 meter which signifies having zero anxiety. When a card mentions an increase in anxiety, the player needs 
                 to move the bead downwards the amount specified, causing the player to be closer to losing. If a card mentions
                  decreased anxiety, then the player moves the bead up the specified amount which means you are further away
                   from losing. The moment that any of the player’s burnout meter reaches the burnout stage the game is over
                   . The game’s goal is for all teachers to survive the whole school year together without anyone reaching burnout. </p>
