            <p>(Bianca Gauthier, January 2020, 18x10 inch, Boardgame)</p>
            <p> Photoshop design, cardboard board and papier mache 
                This was a team project, where we needed to create a board game. Everyone helped with the concept and rules as a team, 
                however, I was the only designer. I was the designer and builder of the game board. 
                I designed the different paths digitally and made the whole physical board game and cards. 
                This game is a 4 player game where the players a captured and wake up in a killer's house, 
                they are trying to create a path to the other end of the board first to escape and try to block the other players. 
                The design helps place the players in this horror environment.

<p>Playing time: 45 minutes </p>
             <p>  
                In the quaint town of Meadowbrook, a sinister figure known as Specterbane utilized the locale 
                as a chilling setting to ensnare victims for his twisted death trap. Operating from his hidden hideout, 
                Specterbane would abduct four teenagers, compelling them to participate in his twisted game. Once ensnared, 
                the captives were subjected to two rules: navigate the ominous challenges and race to the exit for a chance 
                at survival, knowing that only one among them could emerge alive.
                This rulebook will guide you through all you need to know to play PsychoPaths.

            <p> The Setup:</p>
           <p>
            Begin by selecting a color and collecting your tokens. Choose a side on the board.
            Shuffle the pile of path tiles and place them face down. Each player draws 8 path tiles,
             putting them in their placeholder. The remaining tiles are placed face down to create a draw pile.
            Shuffle the action cards and create a single face-down pile next to the draw pile.
            Once all players are ready, begin the game, starting with the youngest player.
            </p>

           <p>The object of the game:</p> 
           <p> The 4 players are chosen to participate in a deadly match, where their survival depends on creating an escape route.
             The participant that has put the most tiles in the creation of a complete path from their side of the board to the opposite side wins. 
            This means that each player holds a distinct objective. Their objectives, however, could merge together: 
             players 1 and 3 create paths towards each other, and players 2 and 4 create paths towards each other.
             Note that a complete route should connect the starting line to the finish line.

            <p>We aimed to create a game that encouraged players to perceive strategies as inherently competitive
                 while maintaining a superficial understanding.</p>
